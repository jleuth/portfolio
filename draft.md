Frantic

Frantic Software, LLC was a company I ran that specialized in creating I.T. infrastructure management solutions for cross-platform cloud deployments. It was also a startup that I ran alone, 24/7, no breaks, and NO help. 

It started as a personal project to learn more about AWS. I just thought it was interesting. Eventually I needed a reason to go bigger with AWS, so I figured a company would be fun; hey, I could be a founder, right?? That passion project became the death of me, and turning it into a company was absolutely one of the worst decisions I'd ever made.

I worked myself into the ground. I was so drilled into the idea that "founders don't rest" that I quite literally spent every waking moment doing SOMETHING for the company. If I were at school, I was planning, doing BizAdm, or researching how to do the things I want to. When I was at home, I was either coding or going to work (because for some reason I thought getting a normal job would be a good idea on top of this). I figured being absolutely miserable was just part of the grind. I wasn't just burning out, I was crashing and exploding into flames. I stopped being social, stopped going out, stopped being okay.

On the final day, my family intervened and told me I had to shut the company down. I'm very grateful they did, because if I hadn't have heard it from someone else, I would've worked myself to death, literally. It was so nice to just be... over. Not give a shit anymore. I lost purpose for a little while, because what the hell am I if not a founder when I'd spent every hour of the past year ingraining it into my life? However, I rediscovered that purpose through Hack Club, and remembering what brought me to becoming a founder in the first place.

The product was never the problem, I still think it was a great idea. But building a company around it, alone, at that age, not knowing what the hell I was doing, or what I was getting myself into... it broke me. But it also taught me a lot. How to move fast, think critically under immense pressure, and how NOT to run a startup.

I don't necessarily see Frantic as a failure, just a hard-earned life lesson. I did end up walking away with better skills, more maturity, and a wholly different outlook on life. I didn't sacrifice a whole year of my life for nothing!

RIP Frantic. You were fun, and hell. Fuck you, and I love you.

Future Computing:

Future Computing is a nonprofit I founded after closing Frantic. I found that philanthropic work drew me in so much more than making money, because it came without pressure. When you’re doing good work without people breathing down your neck to make money, get customers, or release on-time, life is so much more enjoyable.

FC aims to help kickstart the careers of teens in tech by giving them the resources they need to hit the ground running. FC offers several grants paid for by donors/partnering companies to give teens free education, infrastructure, domains, and the opportunity to ask for anything else they might need. All our applications are reviewed holistically. That means no automation, every application for a grant is read and considered by a human, so there’s no SEO wording needed to get onto the desk of someone who knows what they’re doing.

I’m so much happier running FC, because I know that I’m running no risk, nor do I have to suck up to investors. I get to see, and help my peers in any way I can, and that’s way more fulfilling to me than getting rich or having some “entrepreneur” status.

Film/Design

I occasionally do film and design projects when I get a creative burst. Film, design, and other art is how I make sense of the world. Where work fails, I turn to writing, designing, and storytelling.

Art is the one place where I get to be as inconsistent, imperfect, and ugly as I want to be, and that’s what makes it so fun. A lot of that work blends pretty visuals with introspection, and express some sort of larger meaning. Some pieces are quiet, some are chaotic, and most live in-between. I find art to be a very intimate thing, so 99% of what I do never gets released, and that’s alright. 

Sometimes it’s posters, sometimes it’s album covers, sometimes it’s political jabs, sometimes it’s UI/UX mockups for a totally fake thing. It’s more than side-work, it’s part of my thought process. Never scheduled. Always bouncing around.

YouTube:

My YouTube channel is my time capsule. I don’t post often, or for views, or for recognition. It’s meant to be for me to look back on, and remember the times from before. My Iowa roadtrip, class video projects, that time I made a SaaS product in 3 weeks or something, it’s both fascinating to look back on, and disgusting to look at 12 year old me.

If you’re looking for something interesting, you probably won’t find it here. But if you wanna learn more about what the hell goes through my head, or wanna see weird, experimental content, have at it.

Web:

Some of my projects don’t fit into a category, and they end up here. A smorgasbord of really cool, barely functional, incredibly experimental projects that were a lot of fun to make. 

This is a non-exhaustive list (that will not be updated, I clearly won’t remember)

The Great AI Debate (https://greatdebate.live) - A research project and weeklong event where a bunch of LLMs duke it out gladiator-style over hundreds of different topics and categories which thousands watch then have at it. The idea is to see how LLMs handle debating each other, and biases in their training.

SuperWallClock - a Spotify-enabled wall clock I made with an old monitor and a Pi Zero. It was entirely client-based, so it never relied on a central server to call back to. It showed local weather, currently playing song, UptimeRobot status of my various sites, and, of course, the time!

DIY SlimeVR trackers - I designed and soldered together a full set of open-source SlimeVR trackers. Due to AliExpress’ absolutely nonexistent quality assurance, every IMU I got was absolutely destroyed by drift, and never worked right. But, I got to learn a lot about CAD (and I think this was my first full soldering project).

Sparse Fusion - This research project was a concept for a lightweight Mixture of Experts architecture designed to run high-quality AI on low-resource devices. It used a classifier to route inputs to small, specialized LoRA adapters, then fused their outputs for intelligent, domain-aware responses, all without ever touching a GPU cluster. I never built it when I finished the research and design, but the idea still reflects my obsession with making powerful models run stupidly well on everyday hardware.
